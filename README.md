<i>Selenium(Se, atomic no-34) </i>

Wait! Is that what we're gonna see in this code? 
No! 

<b>Welcome to the line of code which lets you sit and see your facebook account being created, whatsapp being logged in(to some extent). 
</b>

## Description:
This code is associated with Selenium Webdriver with the help of which you can simply automate your task and be a Houdini! 

## Prerequisite: 
If you're using Firefox as your browser, download <b> geckodriver</b>, for google chrome-<b> Chromedriver</b> and for others, do googleðŸ˜œ. Why should I have all the fun??


<i>Remember! Downloading webdrivers alone is not enough. Set up some environment variables for them( add path to them) and now you're good to go with it.
